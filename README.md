# Network Topology Creation Using Cisco Packet Tracer

This repository contains network topology examples created using Cisco Packet Tracer (CPT), demonstrating both classful and classless IP addressing schemes.

## Overview

This project includes practical examples of network topologies designed to illustrate different IP addressing methodologies in network design.

## Files

- **sahil_classfull.pka.pkt** - Network topology example using classful IP addressing
- **sahil_classless.pka.pkt** - Network topology example using classless IP addressing (CIDR)

## Requirements

To open and view these network topology files, you need:

- **Cisco Packet Tracer** (version 7.0 or later recommended)
  - Download from: [Cisco Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer)

## Getting Started

1. Install Cisco Packet Tracer on your system
2. Open Packet Tracer
3. Navigate to `File > Open` and select one of the `.pka.pkt` files
4. Explore the network topology, devices, and configurations

## Network Topologies

### Classful Addressing (sahil_classfull.pka.pkt)
This topology demonstrates traditional classful IP addressing where IP addresses are divided into classes (A, B, C, D, E) with fixed subnet masks.

### Classless Addressing (sahil_classless.pka.pkt)
This topology demonstrates classless inter-domain routing (CIDR), which allows for more flexible subnetting and efficient use of IP address space.

## Features

- Pre-configured network devices (routers, switches, PCs)
- IP addressing schemes implementation
- Network connectivity demonstrations
- Practical examples for learning network design

## Usage

1. Open the desired `.pka.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer
2. Review the network topology and device configurations
3. Use simulation mode to observe packet flow
4. Modify configurations as needed for experimentation

## Notes

- These files are compatible with Cisco Packet Tracer
- Make sure you have the appropriate version of Packet Tracer installed
- You can modify the topologies for your own learning and experimentation
